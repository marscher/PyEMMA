	abstract = {A rigorous formalism for the extraction of state-to-state transition functions from a Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations has been developed as a way to study the kinetics of protein folding in the context of a Markov chain. Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

	abstract = {We extend the jackknife and the bootstrap method of estimating standard errors to the case where the observations form a general stationary sequence. We do not attempt a reduction to i.i.d. values. The jackknife calculates the sample variance of replicates of the statistic obtained by omitting each block of l consecutive data once. In the case of the arithmetic mean this is shown to be equivalent to a weighted covariance estimate of the spectral density of the observations at zero. Under appropriate conditions consistency is obtained if l = l(n) → ∞ and l(n)/n → 0. General statistics are approximated by an arithmetic mean. In regular cases this approximation determines the asymptotic behavior. Bootstrap replicates are constructed by selecting blocks of length l randomly with replacement among the blocks of observations. The procedures are illustrated by using the sunspot numbers and some simulated data.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to estimate transition rates between conformational substates of the simulated molecule. Such an estimation is associated with statistical uncertainty, which depends on the number of observed transitions. In turn, it induces uncertainties in any property computed from the simulation, such as free energy differences or the time scales involved in the system’s kinetics. Assessing these uncertainties is essential for testing the reliability of a given observation and also to plan further simulations in such a way that the most serious uncertainties will be reduced with minimal effort. Here, a rigorous statistical method is proposed to approximate the complete statistical distribution of any observable of an MD simulation provided that one can identify conformational substates such that the transition process between them may be modeled with a memoryless jump process, i.e., Markov or Master equation dynamics. The method is based on sampling the statistical distribution of Markov transition matrices that is induced by the observed transition events. It allows physically meaningful constraints to be included, such as sampling only matrices that fulfill detailed balance, or matrices that produce a predefined equilibrium distribution of states. The method is illustrated on μ s MD simulations of a hexapeptide for which the distributions and uncertainties of the free energy differences between conformations, the transition matrix elements, and the transition matrix eigenvalues are estimated. It is found that both constraints, detailed balance and predefined equilibrium distribution, can significantly reduce the uncertainty of some observables.},

	abstract = {Reversibility is a key concept in Markov models and Master-equation models of molecular kinetics. The analysis and interpretation of the transition matrix encoding the kinetic properties of the model relies heavily on the reversibility property. The estimation of a reversible transition matrix from simulation data is therefore crucial to the successful application of the previously developed theory. In this work we discuss methods for the maximum likelihood estimation of transition matrices from finite simulation data and present a new algorithm for the estimation if reversibility with respect to a given stationary vector is desired. We also develop new methods for the Bayesian posterior inference of reversible transition matrices with and without given stationary vector taking into account the need for a suitable prior distribution preserving the meta- stable features of the observed process during posterior inference. All algorithms here are implemented in the PyEMMA software - http://pyemma.org - as of version 2.0.},
